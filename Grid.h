/* 

In this exercise you will implement a class representing
 a terrain in the form of a rectangular grid. The cells of the
 grid are indexed with pairs of integers, where (0,0) 
 represents the lower left cell, and (m-1,n-1) represents
 the top right cell, where m is the width and n is the height 
 of the grid. For example, a grid of width 4 and height 3 is 
 indexed in the following way:

(0,2)(1,2)(2,2)(3,2)
(0,1)(1,1)(2,1)(3,1)
(0,0)(1,0)(2,0)(3,0)

Some of the cells of the grid are blocked by obstacles.
We are interested in determining whether there is a path to 
reach a given goal cell from a given start cell by moving 
one cell at a time in each of the four cardinal directions: 
North, East, West, South, and never entering a blocked cell
or stepping outside of the grid. You will write functions 
that compute and output such a path if it exists.

In the example above, suppose that cells (3,0), (3,2),
(0,1) and (1,1) are blocked. If the start is (0,0) and
the goal is (0,2), then we have the following path 
(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(0,2).

You are advised to use the STL containers for storing
information. This should help you implement this class.
